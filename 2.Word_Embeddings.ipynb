The expected input in this case will be [CLS] This is my test sentence. [SEP]\n","\n","We passed one sentence at a time to the BERT model. The BERT tokenizer tries to convert the input sentence into different tokens. Initially, the input sentence is split on whitespaces giving the tokenizer all the words in the sentence. The aim of the tokenizer is to keep the all the words intact. Hence, the BERT tokenizer will try to map every word it finds in input to some token defined in vocab.txt. If it doesn’t find a token to map for any word, it will break down the word into smaller tokens. For example, vocab.txt doesn’t contain the word ‘embeddings’. Hence, the tokenizer splits the word embeddings into four different tokens [‘em’, ‘##bed’, ‘##ding’, ‘##s’] so that it retains some contextual meaning of the word.\n","\n","BERT is trained on sentence pairs and it expects sentence pairs as an input. We usually distinguish between sentences in sentence pairs using 1s and 0s. In our case, we will always pass one sentence at a time. Hence, we create a vector of length same as the length of sentence tokens having all 1s. We pass this vector as segment IDs.\n","\n","We get full set of hidden states as an output when we pass token IDs and segment IDs to the BERT model.

We add up last four layers to create word vector for any particular token. Word vector of every word is a now an array of 768 items.
